# Sound Sync

If you have more than one device or wish to use [Line Input](Line-Input) but your audio source is not right next where your LEDs are, then Audio Sync is the feature you need, no need for multiple mics or long cables

For the WLED instance that you wish to be the source, simply set the Sync mode in the Audio Reactive module to Send and then use Recieve on all the WLED instances you wish to use the data
